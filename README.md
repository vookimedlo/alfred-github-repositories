## Usage
In Alfred, type `repos`. This initiate a repository retrieval process, which shows all your public and private GitHub Repositories.

Opening in default browser could be overridden, either by pressing the <kbd>⌘</kbd> key, or <kbd>⌥</kbd> key, or <kbd>⌃</kbd> key.

- The first one - <key>⌘</key> - instructs workflow to copy a repository clone URL to clipboard.
- The second one - <key>⌥</key> - instructs workflow to copy a repository CLI git clone command to clipboard.
- The last one - <key>⌃</key> - instructs workflow to open a repository in GitHub Client.

## Configuration
Before the first usage, you are required to fill the workflow variables.

- `user` is your Github username,
- `personalToken` is your Github Personal Token created in your [user settings][3]. If you want to show your private repositories, not just the public ones, select the `repo scope` during the personal token generation.
